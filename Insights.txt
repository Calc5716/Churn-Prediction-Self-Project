
Based on the insights drawn from EDA(present on the notebook), the following data-driven actions can be taken to reduce churn:

1) Personalized Retention Offers:
Offer discounts or bonus add-ons to high-charge, high-risk customers identified by the model before they churn.

2) Proactive Customer Engagement:
Use churn predictions to trigger early outreach campaigns (SMS/email) for customers showing early warning signs.
3) Contract Optimization:
Encourage customers on month-to-month contracts to shift to longer plans with bundled benefits to improve retention.

4) Service Enhancement for Low-Usage Users:
Identify customers with minimal feature usage and recommend tailored service upgrades or tutorials to increase engagement.

5) Feedback Loop Integration:
Capture churned usersâ€™ feedback and integrate it into continuous model retraining, ensuring that the system evolves as customer behavior changes.
