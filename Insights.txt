Long Tenure ≠ Loyalty – Customers with longer tenures still showed high churn probability if they had recent drops in engagement or high monthly charges.

High Monthly Charges – One of the top churn drivers; customers in the highest quartile of billing were ~2.3× more likely to leave.

Contract Type Impact – Month-to-month contract holders churned far more than those on yearly or multi-year plans.

Low Service Usage / Add-ons – Users subscribed only to basic plans (no streaming or value-added services) showed higher churn tendency.

Support Calls & Complaints – A strong correlation between frequent support interactions and churn, suggesting poor experience before exit.


Based on these insights, the following data-driven actions can be taken to reduce churn:

Personalized Retention Offers:
Offer discounts or bonus add-ons to high-charge, high-risk customers identified by the model before they churn.

Proactive Customer Engagement:
Use churn predictions to trigger early outreach campaigns (SMS/email) for customers showing early warning signs (high support frequency, payment delays).

Contract Optimization:
Encourage customers on month-to-month contracts to shift to longer plans with bundled benefits to improve retention.

Service Enhancement for Low-Usage Users:
Identify customers with minimal feature usage and recommend tailored service upgrades or tutorials to increase engagement.

Feedback Loop Integration:
Capture churned users’ feedback and integrate it into continuous model retraining, ensuring that the system evolves as customer behavior changes.
